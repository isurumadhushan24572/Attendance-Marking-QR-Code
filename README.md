# QR Attendance System - 2nd Year 2nd sem Group project

## Introduction
This project aims to enhance the efficiency of the educational attendance system by implementing a QR code-based solution using AWS services. The primary focus is on accelerating the QR code loading process to streamline attendance tracking in educational environments.

## Problem & Solution
The main challenge addressed in this project is the slow QR code loading process. To overcome this, we designed a system that evaluates and improves performance, ultimately leading to the creation of a fast QR attendance system utilizing AWS services.

## Project Timeline
Created AWS Free Tier Account.
Set up a Windows EC2 Instance.
Installed PHP and Apache on the Virtual Machine.
Launched Apache server in the virtual machine.
Created MySQL database using AWS RDS service.
Enabled necessary ports for Apache and MySQL in security groups.
Established a database (SF) with tables (register, attendance) using MySQL Workbench.
Imported website files (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) into Apache htdocs.
Successfully launched the complete website.
Performance Evaluation
Conducted performance evaluations for 50 and 150 students, assessing both virtual machine and database performance. Additionally, ran Anaconda Navigator software inside the host machine, collecting performance data for 50 students.

## Circumstances Faced
Encountered challenges such as inbound and outbound port issues, AWS account suspension, Apache server and PHP connectivity, and responsive content display issues.

## Cost of the Project
Incurred a cost of USD 1.25 on AWS Relational Database Service during the project.

## Project Methodology
Utilized various AWS services, including EC2 instances and RDS, implemented an Apache server with PHP, and managed the database using MySQL. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP files.

## Project Outcome
The Fast QR Attendance System was successfully implemented, addressing the initial problem of system delays during attendance tracking. The system now efficiently manages attendance for a larger number of students.

## Conclusion
By leveraging AWS services and optimizing the system architecture, we have developed a robust solution for prompt student attendance tracking. This project not only resolves the identified problem but also demonstrates the scalability and reliability of cloud-based solutions in educational contexts.
